# Self-driving-car

This is the code I wrote during the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course:

The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  1. Car driving mechanics
  2. Road definition
  3. Simulating the sensors
  4. Detecting collisions
  5. Adding traffic
  6. Neural network
  7. Optimization
  8. Fine-tuning
